# Annoucement: Release of Real-Twin Tool is expected to be end of 2024. 

Real-Twin tool is funded by Department of Energy (DOE)-Vehicle Technology Office (VTO)-Energy Efficient Mobility Systems (EEMS) program. It is part of the core tools of EEMS.
Project Lead: Oak Ridge National Lab
Project Team: University of Georgia

The overarching goal of Real-Twin is to deliver a realistic and consistent scenario generation capability that ingests real data and provides a twin for analyzing decarbonization opportunities and evaluating mobility objectives in simulation, virtual environments, and/or XIL. A typical Real-Twin usage would be as the following: users select the technology of interest and provide available real-world data, then the Real-Twin will generate relevant scenarios as well as the implementation of these scenarios in different simulators of XIL (such as traffic simulator VISSIM/SUMO, vehicle simulator IPG CarMaker/Carla). Note that real-world data from users are optional for Real-Twin. If users do not provide any data, Real-Twin will use available data sets identified in this project to output scenarios. If users do provide data, for example, users want to study a particular corridor of a specific city and have real-world data collected from this corridor [1], then Real-Twin can synthesize the data to generate scenarios that can reflect this particular corridor. The objectives of this project are further identified and described in detail below.
